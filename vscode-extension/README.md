**Control Microsoft Excel with AI through GitHub Copilot - just ask in natural language!**

**MCP Server for Excel** enables AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) to automate Excel through natural language commands. Automate Power Query, DAX measures, VBA macros, PivotTables, Charts, formatting, and data transformations - no Excel programming knowledge required. 

**🛡️ 100% Safe - Uses Excel's Native COM API** - Zero risk of file corruption. Unlike third-party libraries that manipulate `.xlsx` files directly, this project uses Excel's official API ensuring complete safety and compatibility.

**💡 Interactive Development** - See results instantly in Excel. Create a query, run it, inspect the output, refine and repeat. Excel becomes your AI-powered workspace for rapid development and testing.

**🧪 LLM-Tested Quality** - Tool behavior validated with real LLM workflows using [pytest-aitest](https://github.com/sbroenne/pytest-aitest). We test that LLMs correctly understand and use our tools.

### Agent Skills (Bundled)

This extension includes **Agent Skills** following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification - providing domain-specific guidance for AI assistants. Two skills are bundled:

- **[excel-mcp](https://github.com/sbroenne/mcp-server-excel/blob/main/skills/excel-mcp/SKILL.md)** - MCP Server tool guidance
- **[excel-cli](https://github.com/sbroenne/mcp-server-excel/blob/main/skills/excel-cli/SKILL.md)** - CLI terminal automation guidance

**VS Code setup:** Enable the preview setting `chat.useAgentSkills` to allow Copilot to load skills. Skills are registered via VS Code's `chatSkills` contribution point and managed automatically.


## 💬 Example Prompts

**Create & Populate Data:**
- *"Create a new Excel file called SalesTracker.xlsx with a table for Date, Product, Quantity, Unit Price, and Total"*
- *"Put this data in A1:C4 - Name, Age, City / Alice, 30, Seattle / Bob, 25, Portland"*
- *"Add sample data and a formula column for Quantity times Unit Price"*

**Analysis & Visualization:**
- *"Create a PivotTable from this data showing total sales by Product, then add a bar chart"*
- *"Import products.csv with Power Query, load to Data Model, create a measure for Total Revenue"*
- *"Create a slicer for the Region field so I can filter the PivotTable interactively"*

**Formatting & Automation:**
- *"Format the Price column as currency and highlight values over $500 in green"*
- *"Export all Power Query M code to files for version control"*
- *"Show me Excel while you work"* - watch changes in real-time


## Quick Start

1. **Install this extension** (you just did!)
2. **Ask Copilot** in the chat panel:
   - "List all Power Query queries in workbook.xlsx"
   - "Create a DAX measure for year-over-year revenue growth"
   - "Export all Powere Queires and VBA modules to .vba files for version control"

**That's it!** The extension includes self-contained MCP server and CLI executables - no .NET runtime or SDK needed.

## Requirements

- **Windows OS** - Excel COM automation requires Windows
- **Microsoft Excel 2016+** - Must be installed on your system

## Potential Issues

**"Excel is not installed" error:**
- Ensure Microsoft Excel 2016+ is installed on your Windows machine
- Try opening Excel manually to verify it works

**"VBA access denied" error:**
- VBA operations require one-time manual setup in Excel
- Go to: File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Macro Settings
- Check "Trust access to the VBA project object model"

**Copilot doesn't see Excel tools:**
- Restart VS Code after installing the extension
- ### Troubleshooting

- Check Output panel → "Excel MCP Server" for connection status
