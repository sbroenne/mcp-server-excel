**Control Microsoft Excel with AI through GitHub Copilot - just ask in natural language!**

**MCP Server for Excel** enables AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) to automate Excel through natural language commands. Automate Power Query, DAX measures, VBA macros, PivotTables, Charts, formatting, and data transformations - no Excel programming knowledge required. 

**🛡️ 100% Safe - Uses Excel's Native COM API** - Zero risk of file corruption. Unlike third-party libraries that manipulate `.xlsx` files directly, this project uses Excel's official API ensuring complete safety and compatibility.

**💡 Interactive Development** - See results instantly in Excel. Create a query, run it, inspect the output, refine and repeat. Excel becomes your AI-powered workspace for rapid development and testing.

## Quick Start

1. **Install this extension** (you just did!)
2. **Ask Copilot** in the chat panel:
   - "List all Power Query queries in workbook.xlsx"
   - "Create a DAX measure for year-over-year revenue growth"
   - "Export all Powere Queires and VBA modules to .vba files for version control"

**That's it!** The extension automatically installs .NET 8 runtime and includes a bundled MCP server.

## Requirements

- **Windows OS** - Excel COM automation requires Windows
- **Microsoft Excel 2016+** - Must be installed on your system
- **.NET 8 Runtime** - **Automatically installed** by the extension

## Potential Issues

**"Excel is not installed" error:**
- Ensure Microsoft Excel 2016+ is installed on your Windows machine
- Try opening Excel manually to verify it works

**"VBA access denied" error:**
- VBA operations require one-time manual setup in Excel
- Go to: File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Macro Settings
- Check "Trust access to the VBA project object model"

**Copilot doesn't see Excel tools:**
- Restart VS Code after installing the extension
- ### Troubleshooting

- Check Output panel → "Excel MCP Server" for connection status
