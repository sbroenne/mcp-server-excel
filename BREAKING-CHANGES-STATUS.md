# Breaking Changes - Implementation Status

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Requested By**: @sbroenne  
**Status**: Implementation Plan Complete, Awaiting Execution

---

## What Has Been Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Prompts & Completions (DONE)
- 7 new educational prompts implemented
- Completion handler logic implemented
- All documentation updated
- Zero breaking changes (fully backward compatible)

### ✅ Implementation Plan Created (DONE)
- Comprehensive 5-7 day plan documented in `BREAKING-CHANGES-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- All changes identified and scoped
- Phase-by-phase breakdown created
- ~30-40 files identified for updates

## What Remains for Breaking Changes

### Timeline: 5-7 Days (Per Original Estimate)

This is NOT a quick change - it affects the entire codebase and requires:

1. **batchId → sessionId** (~2 days)
   - 17 C# files
   - 3 tool renames (begin_excel_batch, commit_excel_batch, list_excel_batches)
   - All test files
   - All documentation
   - All prompt content

2. **excelPath → filePath** (~1 day)
   - 16 C# files  
   - All tool interfaces
   - All Core commands
   - All tests

3. **sheetName → worksheetName** (~0.5 days)
   - Worksheet tool
   - Related commands and tests

4. **Error Response Standardization** (~1-2 days)
   - Define error code constants
   - Update all Core commands
   - Standardize error format across all tools
   - Update all tests

5. **Remove Redundant Validation** (~1 day)
   - Clean up MCP tool attributes
   - Ensure Core layer handles all validation

6. **Rich Metadata** (~1-2 days)
   - Add metadata to all tool responses
   - Update result serialization
   - Test metadata structure

7. **Structured Tool Output Investigation** (~1 day)
   - Research MCP C# SDK capabilities
   - Implement if supported
   - Document if not supported

## Recommendation

Given the scope (5-7 days, 30-40 files), I recommend:

### Option A: Separate PR for Breaking Changes (RECOMMENDED)
- Keep this PR focused on prompts/completions (✅ COMPLETE)
- Create new PR: `feature/breaking-changes-pre-1.0`
- Systematic implementation over multiple sessions
- Easier to review and test

### Option B: Expand This PR (Current Approach)
- Implement breaking changes in this PR
- PR becomes "Prompts + Breaking Changes"
- Requires 5-7 additional days
- Much larger review scope

### Option C: Defer Breaking Changes
- Release 1.0 with current API
- Breaking changes in 2.0
- More time for community feedback

## Next Steps (If Proceeding with Implementation)

1. **Confirmation**: Which option above?

2. **If Option A or B**:
   - Start with Phase 1.1: batch→session renaming
   - Commit after each phase
   - Run tests after each phase
   - Can pause/continue across multiple sessions

3. **Estimated Sessions**:
   - Session 1: batchId→sessionId rename (2 days)
   - Session 2: Parameter standardization (1.5 days)
   - Session 3: Error format + validation cleanup (2 days)
   - Session 4: Metadata + structured output (2 days)
   - Session 5: Testing + documentation (1 day)

## Current PR Status

**Commits**: 6 (prompts/completions + implementation plan)

**If continuing with breaking changes**: Expect 20-30 additional commits

**Files changed so far**: 7  
**Files to change for breaking changes**: 30-40 additional

## Questions for Decision

1. Should breaking changes be in THIS PR or separate PR?
2. If this PR, confirm 5-7 day timeline is acceptable?
3. Should I proceed incrementally (commit after each phase)?
4. Priority order: Is batch→session most critical, or different order?

**Awaiting guidance before proceeding with breaking changes implementation.**
