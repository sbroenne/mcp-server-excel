### About the Author

Stefan Broenner is the creator and maintainer of ExcelMcp, a command-line interface tool designed specifically for coding agents and developers to automate Microsoft Excel operations. With a focus on creating clean, reliable tools that bridge the gap between AI coding assistants and Excel automation, Stefan has developed ExcelMcp to be the premier solution for programmatic Excel manipulation.

### Project Vision

ExcelMcp was born from the need for a simple, reliable way for coding agents like GitHub Copilot to interact with Excel files. Rather than dealing with complex OpenXML libraries or unreliable automation, ExcelMcp provides direct COM automation that uses Excel's native VBA object model for maximum compatibility and reliability.
