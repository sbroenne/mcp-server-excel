# Implementation Plan: Improve Testing Coverage with Azure Self-Hosted Runners

**Status:** üìã Implementation Plan  
**Created:** 2025-10-31  
**Issue:** [FEATURE] Improve testing coverage

## Problem Statement

ExcelMcp requires Microsoft Excel for integration testing via COM automation. Current CI/CD runs on GitHub-hosted `windows-latest` runners which **do not include Microsoft Excel**. This means:

- ‚ùå Integration tests (Category=Integration) are **skipped** in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Only Unit tests (Category=Unit) run in CI/CD
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration test coverage exists but requires manual local execution
- üìä ~91 integration tests exist but don't run automatically

## Solution: Azure Self-Hosted Runners

Deploy a Windows VM in Azure with Microsoft Excel and GitHub Actions self-hosted runner to enable automated integration testing.

### Architecture Overview

```
GitHub Actions Workflow
    ‚Üì (trigger)
Azure Windows VM
    - Windows Server 2022
    - .NET 8 SDK
    - Microsoft Excel (Office 365)
    - GitHub Actions Runner
    ‚Üì (execute)
Integration Tests (Category=Integration)
    - Core.Tests (Excel COM operations)
    - CLI.Tests (Command-line interface)
    - McpServer.Tests (MCP protocol)
    - ComInterop.Tests (COM session management)
```

## Implementation Approach

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Documentation (Current)

**Deliverables:**
1. **`docs/AZURE_SELFHOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
   - Azure VM provisioning (Portal + CLI)
   - .NET 8 SDK installation
   - Microsoft Excel installation & configuration
   - GitHub runner installation & service setup
   - Network security & firewall configuration
   - Cost estimates & optimization strategies
   - Troubleshooting & maintenance procedures

2. **`.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`** - New workflow
   - Runs on `[self-hosted, windows, excel]` labels
   - Scheduled nightly execution (2 AM UTC)
   - Manual workflow_dispatch trigger
   - Executes all integration tests (Category=Integration)
   - Excel process cleanup after tests
   - Test result artifacts uploaded

### üîÑ Phase 2: Runner Deployment (To Be Done)

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription with VM creation permissions
- Office 365 license (E3/E5 or standalone Excel)
- GitHub repository admin access

**Tasks:**
1. Provision Azure Windows VM (Standard_D2s_v3 recommended)
2. Install .NET 8 SDK on VM
3. Install & activate Microsoft Excel
4. Configure Excel for automation (disable splash screens, enable VBA access)
5. Install GitHub Actions runner as Windows service
6. Register runner with `self-hosted`, `windows`, `excel` labels
7. Configure auto-shutdown schedule to save costs
8. Test runner with integration-tests.yml workflow

### üöÄ Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (Optional)

**Tasks:**
1. Add integration test status badge to README.md
2. Update existing workflows to reference integration tests
3. Configure notifications for integration test failures
4. Set up monitoring for runner health

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost (Pay-as-you-go, East US)

| Resource | Specification | Cost/Month |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| VM (Standard_D2s_v3) | 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM | ~$70 |
| Storage (Premium SSD) | 128 GB P10 | ~$20 |
| Network | ~10 GB egress | ~$1 |
| **Total (24/7)** | | **~$91** |

### Cost Optimization

1. **Auto-shutdown** (7 PM daily)
   - Running 12 hours/day: **~$45/month**
   - Storage always charged: **+$20**
   - **Total: ~$65/month**

2. **Scheduled runs only**
   - Start VM for nightly tests
   - Run for 2 hours/day: **~$10/month**
   - Storage always charged: **+$20**
   - **Total: ~$30/month**

3. **B-series burstable VM**
   - Standard_B2s: 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM
   - Running 24/7: **~$30/month**
   - Storage: **+$20**
   - **Total: ~$50/month**

**Recommended:** Start with auto-shutdown schedule (~$65/month), move to scheduled-only if feasible (~$30/month).

## Testing Strategy

### Current State

```bash
# CI/CD (GitHub-hosted runners) - No Excel
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit&RunType!=OnDemand"
# Result: ~46 unit tests pass

# Local Developer (with Excel installed)
dotnet test --filter "(Category=Unit|Category=Integration)&RunType!=OnDemand"
# Result: ~137 tests pass (46 unit + 91 integration)

# Pool cleanup (manual, with Excel)
dotnet test --filter "RunType=OnDemand"
# Result: ~5 tests (Excel process cleanup validation)
```

### Future State (with Azure runner)

```bash
# CI/CD Unit Tests (GitHub-hosted runners) - No change
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit&RunType!=OnDemand"
# Result: ~46 unit tests

# CI/CD Integration Tests (Self-hosted Azure runner) - NEW
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration&RunType!=OnDemand"
# Result: ~91 integration tests

# Total automated coverage: ~137 tests
```

### Test Categories

| Category | Tests | Requires Excel | Runs In | Execution Time |
|----------|-------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Unit | ~46 | ‚ùå No | GitHub-hosted | 2-5 sec |
| Integration | ~91 | ‚úÖ Yes | Self-hosted Azure | 13-15 min |
| OnDemand | ~5 | ‚úÖ Yes | Manual only | 3-5 min |
| **Total** | **~142** | | | |

## Alternatives Considered

### ‚ùå GitHub-Hosted Larger Runners with Excel

**Why rejected:** GitHub-hosted runners (even enterprise larger runners) do not include Microsoft Office/Excel.

### ‚ùå Third-Party CI/CD with Excel

**Options:** BuildJet, Cirrus CI  
**Why rejected:** Higher cost, vendor lock-in, less control over environment.

### ‚ùå Docker/Containers with Excel

**Why rejected:** Excel COM automation requires full Windows Desktop experience. Windows Server Core containers don't support Excel UI automation.

### ‚ùå Mock/Stub Excel COM

**Why rejected:** ExcelMcp's core value proposition is **real Excel COM automation**. Mocking would not test actual Excel behavior (Power Query engine, VBA runtime, Data Model, calculation engine).

### ‚úÖ Azure Self-Hosted Runner (Selected)

**Advantages:**
- Full control over environment
- Real Excel COM testing
- Flexible cost management (auto-shutdown, scheduled runs)
- Integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions
- Can scale with VMSS in future

**Disadvantages:**
- Monthly Azure costs (~$30-$91)
- Requires VM maintenance
- Runner configuration overhead
