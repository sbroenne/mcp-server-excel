# Azure Runner Setup Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The user requested:
1. Manual GitHub runner installation instructions (since automated provisioning failed)
2. Fix the deployment workflow to handle failures better

## Solution Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Manual Installation Guide

**File:** `docs/MANUAL_RUNNER_INSTALLATION.md`

Complete step-by-step guide for manually installing GitHub Actions runner on existing Windows VM:

**When to use:** 
- Automated deployment workflow failed
- User already has Windows VM provisioned
- User wants complete control over setup

**Time:** 15 minutes + 30 minutes for Excel installation

### 2. Improved Bicep Template

**File:** `infrastructure/azure/azure-runner.bicep`

**Before:** Single long PowerShell command (fragile, hard to debug)
**After:** External script reference with proper error handling

**Changes:**
- Replaced 200+ char inline command with script reference
- Downloads `setup-runner.ps1` from GitHub repository
- Easier to update and maintain
- Better failure diagnostics

**Features:**
✅ Comprehensive error handling with try/catch
✅ Detailed logging to `C:\runner-setup.log`
✅ Step-by-step progress tracking (7 steps)
✅ Timestamp for each log entry
✅ Validates .NET installation
✅ Verifies service status
✅ Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Benefits:**
- Easy to debug failures (check log file)
- Can be run manually if needed
- Validated with PowerShell parser
- Follows best practices

### 4. Enhanced Deployment Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-runner.yml`

**Improvements:**
- Better output messages with troubleshooting guidance
- References to manual installation guide
- Instructions for checking runner setup logs
- Clear next steps after deployment

---

### 5. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `infrastructure/azure/GITHUB_ACTIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added manual fallback reference
- `infrastructure/azure/README.md` - Added quick start improvements
- `docs/AZURE_SELFHOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP.md` - Updated with manual guide references

**New Documentation:**
- `docs/AZURE_RUNNER_QUICKSTART.md` - Decision tree and quick reference

## How to Use

### Scenario 1: First-time Setup (No VM)

**Recommended:** Use automated deployment
1. Follow `infrastructure/azure/GITHUB_ACTIONS_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Run workflow from GitHub Actions UI
3. If it fails, fall back to manual installation

### Scenario 2: Automated Deployment Failed

**Recommended:** Use manual installation
1. RDP to the VM (it was created, but runner setup failed)
2. Follow `docs/MANUAL_RUNNER_INSTALLATION.md`
3. Complete steps 1-9
4. Verify runner appears in GitHub

### Scenario 3: Existing Windows VM

**Recommended:** Use manual installation
1. Ensure VM has .NET 8 SDK or install it
2. Follow `docs/MANUAL_RUNNER_INSTALLATION.md`
3. Skip VM provisioning steps
