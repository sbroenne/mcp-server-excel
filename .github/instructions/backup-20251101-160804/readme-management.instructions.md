- ‚úÖ New major tool ‚Üí Update `description` to include tool name
- ‚úÖ Repository moved ‚Üí Update `repository.url`
- ‚ùå Don't change `name` (breaks MCP registry references)

---

## ‚úÖ Critical Rules

### Rule 1: Consistency Across All Documentation

**Tool Counts Must Match:**
- All 3 READMEs must show **11 specialized tools**
- All 3 READMEs must show identical action counts per tool
- server.json description should mention key tools
- Example: `excel_datamodel` = **14 actions** (not 15, not 20)

**Version Numbers Must Match:**
- server.json `version` field = NuGet package version
- server.json `packages[0].version` = NuGet package version
- Update both simultaneously during releases

**Safety Messaging Must Match:**
- All READMEs must mention COM API (not "Excel's internal API")
- All READMEs must highlight "zero risk of document corruption"
- All READMEs must mention "interactive development" / "real-time"
- All READMEs must state "active development" / "growing feature set"

**Who Should Use This Must Match:**
- Perfect for: Data analysts, Developers, Business users, Teams
- Not suitable for: Linux/macOS, High-volume batch operations
- Main README also includes: "Server-side data processing" (with library references)

### Rule 2: Verify Against Code Before Claiming Features

**Before documenting tool action counts:**
1. Search for the tool's switch statement (e.g., `ExcelDataModelTool.cs`)
2. Count actual implemented actions in switch cases
3. Check RegularExpression attribute for allowed actions
4. Update all three READMEs with verified count

**Example:**
```csharp
// File: ExcelDataModelTool.cs
[RegularExpression(@"^(list-tables|list-measures|...|update-relationship)$")]
// Count actions in switch statement (line 150-175)
// Result: 14 actions (NOT 15)
```

**Never trust:**
- ‚ùå Private methods that exist but aren't wired to switch
- ‚ùå Documentation claims without code verification
- ‚ùå Old comments or dead code

### Rule 3: No Overclaiming Features

**Accurate Language:**
- ‚úÖ "Most Excel features supported" or "80+ operations"
- ‚úÖ "Currently supports" (implies active development)
- ‚úÖ "Growing feature set" (sets expectations)
- ‚ùå "All Excel features" (impossible claim)
- ‚ùå "Complete support" (overpromise)
- ‚ùå "Full compatibility" (too broad)

**Known Limitations to Acknowledge:**
- DAX calculated columns NOT supported (Excel UI only)
- Subset of Excel capabilities implemented (not all)
- Active development expanding features

### Rule 4: Maintain Appropriate Length

**Length Guidelines:**
- Main README: 250-300 lines (comprehensive reference)
- NuGet README: 80-100 lines (concise gateway)
- VS Code README: 100-120 lines (focused benefits)

**If a README exceeds its target:**
1. Check for duplicate content across sections
2. Look for verbose examples that could be condensed
3. Move detailed content to linked documentation
4. Use collapsible `<details>` sections (main README only)

### Rule 5: Update All Documentation Files Together

**When making changes:**
- Tool count changes ‚Üí Update all 3 READMEs + server.json description (mention key tools)
- Action count changes ‚Üí Update all 3 READMEs
- Safety messaging changes ‚Üí Update all 3 READMEs
- Repository URL changes ‚Üí Update server.json repository.url field
- Major tool additions ‚Üí Update server.json description to list new capabilities
- User benefit changes ‚Üí Update main + VS Code READMEs
- New features ‚Üí Update main README first, then summarize in others

**‚ö†Ô∏è Version numbers are NEVER manually updated:**
- server.json version field is updated automatically by release workflow
- NuGet package version is updated automatically by release workflow
- See `docs/RELEASE-STRATEGY.md` for the release process

**Sequential Update Process:**
1. Update main README (most comprehensive)
2. Extract brief version for NuGet README
3. Extract user-benefit version for VS Code README
4. Verify consistency across all three

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Duplicate Tool Entries
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG:
3. **excel_table** (22 actions) - Excel Tables
...
9. **excel_table** (22 actions) - Excel Tables management
```

**Why wrong:** Same tool listed twice with different descriptions

**Fix:** List each tool exactly once with consistent description

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Unverified Action Counts
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG:
**excel_datamodel** (15 actions) - DAX measures, relationships, calculated columns
```

**Why wrong:**
1. Code has 14 actions (not 15)
2. Calculated columns NOT supported

**Fix:** Verify code, update count, remove unsupported features

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Verbose NuGet README
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG: 527-line NuGet README with detailed examples, architecture diagrams, etc.
```

**Why wrong:** NuGet README should be concise gateway, not duplicate of main README

**Fix:** Reduce to 80-100 lines with brief tool list and link to full docs

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Overclaiming Compatibility
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG:
- ‚úÖ **Full Excel Feature Access** - All Excel features work perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Complete feature support** - Access to everything
```

**Why wrong:** Subset of features implemented, not all

**Fix:** Use "Most features" or "80+ operations" or "Growing feature set"

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Missing Safety Positioning
```markdown
‚ùå WRONG: No mention of COM API safety advantage
```

**Why wrong:** Key differentiator vs third-party .xlsx manipulation libraries

**Fix:** Add "üõ°Ô∏è 100% Safe - Uses Excel's Native API" callout with 3 benefits

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Manually Updating Version Numbers
```json
‚ùå WRONG: 
// Manually editing server.json version field
"version": "1.1.0"
// Or manually editing .csproj version
```

**Why wrong:** Version numbers are automatically managed by release workflow

**Fix:** 
- Never manually update version numbers
- Release workflow updates server.json and .csproj automatically when tags are pushed
- See `docs/RELEASE-STRATEGY.md` for release process

---

Unlike third-party libraries that manipulate `.xlsx` files directly (risking file corruption), ExcelMcp uses **Excel's official COM API**. This ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Zero risk of document corruption** - Excel handles all file operations safely
- ‚úÖ **Interactive development** - See changes in real-time as you work with live Excel files
- ‚úÖ **Growing feature set** - Currently supports 80+ operations across Power Query, Power Pivot, VBA, PivotTables, Tables, and more (active development)
```

### Safety Callout (NuGet - Concise)
```markdown
**üõ°Ô∏è 100% Safe - Uses Excel's Native COM API**

Unlike third-party libraries that manipulate `.xlsx` files (risking corruption), ExcelMcp uses **Excel's official COM automation API**. This guarantees zero risk of file corruption while you work interactively with live Excel files - see your changes happen in real-time. Currently supports 80+ operations with active development expanding capabilities.
```

## üéì Key Lessons Learned

1. **Three READMEs, Three Purposes** - Main (comprehensive), NuGet (gateway), VS Code (benefits). Don't duplicate, differentiate.

2. **Always Verify Counts** - Code is source of truth. Don't trust documentation, comments, or assumptions.

3. **Safety is Key Differentiator** - COM API vs .xlsx manipulation is critical positioning for NuGet/Marketplace discoverability.

4. **Active Development = Manage Expectations** - "Growing feature set" and "Currently supports 80+ operations" sets realistic expectations while showing momentum.

5. **Consistency Builds Trust** - When tool counts, action counts, and messaging match across all READMEs, users trust the documentation.

6. **Concise Converts Better** - NuGet README reduced from 527 lines to 89 lines increased clarity and conversion potential.

7. **Dead Code Misleads** - `ListTableColumnsAsync` exists but not in switch statement. Private methods ‚â† available features.

8. **VS Code Users = GitHub Users** - Same audience, same benefits. Main README and VS Code README should mirror each other in structure and messaging.
