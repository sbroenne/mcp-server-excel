# Query filters
query-filters:
  # Exclude specific queries that may be false positives
  # Uncomment and adjust as needed

  # COM interop may trigger weak crypto warnings for Excel automation
  - exclude:
      id: cs/weak-crypto
      reason: "Excel COM interop uses Windows crypto APIs"

  # Dynamic typing is required for COM interop
  - exclude:
      id: cs/call-to-unmanaged-code
      reason: "Required for Excel COM interop automation"

  # External libraries may use reflection
  - exclude:
      id: cs/reflection
      reason: "External libraries may use reflection"

  # GC.Collect is required for COM interop cleanup
  - exclude:
      id: cs/call-to-gc
      reason: "Explicit GC.Collect() required for COM object cleanup in Excel automation. See COM cleanup pattern in ExcelBatch/ExcelSession."
      paths:
        - 'src/ExcelMcp.ComInterop/Session/**'
        - 'tests/**/Session/**'

  # Test-specific exclusions (note-severity only)
  # Tests often use patterns that are acceptable in test context

  # COMException catch is as specific as possible for COM interop
  - exclude:
      id: cs/catch-of-all-exceptions
      reason: "COMException is the most specific exception for Excel COM interop. No more specific types available."
      paths:
        - 'src/**/DataModel/**'

  # Generic Exception catch in test helpers is acceptable with explanatory comments
  - exclude:
      id: cs/catch-of-all-exceptions
      reason: "Test helper methods document why broad catch is needed (registry access, Excel validation, etc.)"
      paths:
        - 'tests/**/Helpers/**'
        - 'tests/**/Fixtures/**'

  # Empty catch blocks only allowed in test fixtures/cleanup code
  - exclude:
      id: cs/empty-catch-block
      reason: "Test fixture disposal/cleanup may intentionally ignore failures"
      paths:
        - 'tests/**/Fixtures/**'
        - 'tests/**/IAsyncLifetime.cs'
        - 'tests/**/IDisposable.cs'

  # Path.Combine has been replaced with Path.Join across the codebase
  # No exclusions needed - all instances fixed

  # LINQ suggestions in tests are optional
  - exclude:
      id: cs/linq/missed-where
      reason: "Test code readability over performance"
      paths:
        - 'tests/**'

  # Ternary operator suggestions in tests
  - exclude:
      id: cs/missed-ternary-operator
      reason: "Test code clarity over brevity"
      paths:
        - 'tests/**'

  # Useless assignments are legitimate in test setup for clarity/debugging
  # Already fixed: using statements no longer use discard variables
  - exclude:
      id: cs/useless-assignment-to-local
      reason: "Test setup may assign variables for clarity even if unused"
